        <li>  CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li><br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li><br>
        <li><span class="listview">Css is not neccesary</span><span class="listview2"> CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once </li><br>

    <h2 class="head2">CSS can be added to HTML document in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul class="unorderedlist">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML  elements</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span class="this">  in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, </span>because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself. </li>

    <p >When comparing-CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID,on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In CSS, selectors are used to target a sepecific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.
    </p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
